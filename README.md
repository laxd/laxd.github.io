Lawrence Andrews' Blog

I migrated this blog from a wordpress platform to jekyll because i was fed up with having to use a browser based text editor, in addition to having to maintain a database, backups, script updates as well as hosting fees.

Hosting this blog on github with jekyll allows me to add content from wherever i have access to a terminal, and makes everything much simpler should i decide to host it elsewhere as everything is stored in static HTML files.
