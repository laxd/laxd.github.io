I am a Software Engineer at Influential Software, and I specialise in Java. I created this blog as a way of helping myself remember all the tricks and useful information I come across that I think could be useful to someone else (Or myself a short while later!).

Before starting work as a Software Engineer, I completed a Bsc in Mathematics from the University of Plymouth. I realised that there must be a job where I can utilise the logical way of thinking that Maths has, and I found it!

You can find out more about me on [Github](https://github.com/lenny151) and on my [Website](https://lawrenceandrews.co.uk) (Currently under construction)
